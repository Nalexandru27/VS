Given your goal, here's a suggested approach:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values: Impute (fill) or remove them, depending on the extent and nature of missingness.
Clean data: Check for outliers and inconsistencies.
Calculate financial ratios: As described above.
Create lagged variables: Include past values of financial ratios and dividends as features to capture trends.
Normalize/Standardize data: Scale the features to have a similar range.
Dividend Sustainability Model (Classification):

Target Variable: Create a binary target variable: 1 if the company cut its dividend in the following year, 0 otherwise.
Features: Include profitability ratios, liquidity ratios, solvency ratios, cash flow metrics, dividend coverage ratios, and lagged values of these ratios.
Models: Try Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM), and Neural Networks.
Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate performance.
Dividend Growth Prediction (Regression or Time Series):

Target Variable: Dividend growth rate in the following year.
Features: Include profitability ratios, cash flow metrics, payout ratio, lagged dividend growth rates, and macroeconomic indicators (if available).
Models:
Regression: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Neural Networks.
Time Series: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM.
Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R-squared.
Financial Strength Assessment (Clustering or Feature Importance):

Clustering: Use K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to group companies based on financial strength metrics. This can help you identify clusters of companies with consistently strong financials.
Feature Importance: In your classification and regression models, analyze feature importance to identify the financial ratios that are most predictive of dividend sustainability and growth. This provides insights into what truly drives dividend decisions.
Investment Strategy:

Screening:
Start with companies that have a history of consistent dividend payments and dividend growth.
Use the classification model to filter out companies with a high risk of dividend cuts.
Use the regression or time series model to identify companies with the highest predicted dividend growth.
Use clustering or feature importance to focus on companies with strong financial characteristics.

Portfolio Construction:
Diversify your portfolio across different sectors.
Consider factors like market capitalization and liquidity.
Regularly monitor the financial health of your holdings and rebalance your portfolio as needed.
Important Considerations

Backtesting: Test your strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance.
Overfitting: Be careful to avoid overfitting, where your model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Use techniques like cross-validation and regularization. Â  
Data Updates: Regularly update your data and retrain your models to ensure they remain accurate.
External Factors: Consider incorporating external factors like economic conditions, interest rates, and industry trends into your analysis.
Interpretation: Focus on understanding the "why" behind your model's predictions. Don't just blindly follow the results.
