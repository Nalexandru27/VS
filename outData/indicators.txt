Professional analysts, therefore, use AFFO to estimate the REIT’s value. Although FFO is commonly used, professionals tend to focus on AFFO for two reasons:

It measures more precisely the residual cash flow available to shareholders, and it’s thus a better “base number” for estimating value.
It is true residual cash flow and a better predictor of the REIT’s future capacity to pay dividends.

FFO = net income + amortization + depreciation - capital gains from property sales

AFFO = FFO + rent increases - capital expenditures - routine maintenance amounts
